The spring theme includes four color variations called Sky, Mist, Meadow and Sun. Each color variation comes with its own body background image, banner background image and aside background image. 
Admins can choose their preferred version for the Site Home Welcome page by going to Admin, Site. Then click Change default theme settings.
Members can choose the same color variation or a different color variation by going to Settings, Display. 

A key goal of the spring theme is to give admins complete control over their Site Home Welcome page. 

Therefore we include in a separate folder 4 home.html files, 4 home.css files, 4 welcome images, 4 Libre Draw documents for creating your own Welcome image and 4 Libre Draw documents for creating your own Banner Background image. 

The 4 welcome images should be moved to your root images folder. 

The four html and css files should be moved to the root folder. 

To make an html and css Home pair of files active, just rename them home.html and home.css. 

In addition, when you change the home html and css files, for the changes to take effect, you need to open and then save the new home.html and home.css files. Then clear the browser cache and reload the home page.

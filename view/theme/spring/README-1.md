This is the readme file for the spring package. 
Install the zipped spring-theme folder to your Friendica view, theme folder. 
Then unzip the spring-theme file. 
The spring-theme-extras folder contains 4 welcome images that should be moved to your root images folder.
The four html and css files should be moved to the root folder.
To activate a color variation, rename the html file to home.html and rename the css file to home.css.
To switch from one color variation to a different one, rename the html and css files back to their variation name. Then rename the variation you want to activate to home.html and home.css.  
Then clear the browser cache and reload the page. 
The home page is set for two columns with the text and image having equal widths. To change this ratio, just change the fraction ratio for example from 5fr 5 fr to 6fr 4fr. 
The Libre Draw files are for creating your own welcome and banner images.
